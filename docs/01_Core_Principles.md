# 01: The Core Principles of KineticAugment

Every augmentation performed by the KineticAugment framework is governed by a set of foundational principles. These principles ensure that all generated data is not only physically possible but also contextually and semantically sound. They are divided into two categories: **Core Physical Principles** that define the body itself, and **Higher-Order Contextual Principles** that define the body's interaction with its purpose and environment.

## Level 1: Core Physical Principles (The Body in Isolation)

These principles ensure that the augmented motion is valid for a human body, independent of the task or environment.

### 1. Anatomical Plausibility
*   **Definition:** The augmented pose must conform to the static, physiological limits of the human body.
*   **Why it Matters:** Violating this principle results in grotesque and impossible poses, such as broken joints or unnaturally stretched limbs. This is the most basic check for validity.
*   **Key Constraints:**
    *   **Joint Angle Limits:** Joints can only rotate within a specific range (e.g., an elbow's range of motion is ~0° to 150°). Augmentations must be clamped to these limits.
    *   **Limb Length Stability:** The distance between connected joints (representing bone length) must remain nearly constant. A small amount of variance (e.g., ±5%) is acceptable to simulate perspective changes or soft-tissue artifacts, but large changes are unrealistic.
*   **Implementation:** Enforced via parameter clamping and distance checks after a transformation.

### 2. Kinematic Chain Consistency
*   **Definition:** The human skeleton is a hierarchical kinematic chain. A transformation applied to a "parent" joint must propagate realistically to all "child" joints.
*   **Why it Matters:** Without this, the body becomes a disconnected "bag of points." Moving a shoulder must result in the entire arm moving as a cohesive unit, not just the shoulder landmark in isolation.
*   **Example:** If you apply a rotation to the shoulder joint, the positions of the elbow, wrist, and hand must be recalculated based on that rotation to maintain the arm's structure.
*   **Implementation:** Managed using forward kinematics, where transformations are applied hierarchically from the root of a limb (e.g., shoulder) outwards.

### 3. Inter-Limb Coordination
*   **Definition:** The movement of different limbs, particularly the left and right sides of the body, is rarely independent. Augmentations should respect the natural correlation (or anti-correlation) between them. This is a more general version of "bilateral symmetry."
*   **Why it Matters:** Independent noise applied to symmetric limbs looks jarring and unnatural. Coordinated noise reflects how the nervous system controls movement for balance and efficiency.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Symmetry:** In a two-handed sign or jumping-jack motion, both arms should be augmented in a correlated way.
    *   **Anti-Symmetry:** In walking or running, the arms and legs move in opposition. Augmentations should preserve this anti-correlated relationship.
*   **Implementation:** Applying correlated noise patterns instead of fully independent random noise to paired limbs.

### 4. Temporal Coherence
*   **Definition:** Human motion is smooth and continuous over time. Augmentations must preserve the logical flow of movement and respect the limits of human dynamics.
*   **Why it Matters:** This principle prevents the generation of jerky, physically impossible motion. A joint cannot teleport from one position to another in a single frame.
*   **Key Constraints:**
    *   **Smooth Transitions:** Perturbations should be applied smoothly over several frames, for instance, using a low-frequency noise function like Perlin noise.
    *   **Velocity & Acceleration Limits:** The frame-to-frame change in joint positions and angles must be capped to realistic maximums.
*   **Implementation:** Applying noise via smooth functions and using post-processing filters (e.g., a low-pass filter) to ensure smoothness.

## Level 2: Higher-Order Contextual Principles (The Body in the World)

These principles ensure that the physically possible motion is also valid within its specific context.

### 5. Semantic Integrity
*   **Definition:** An augmentation must not change the fundamental meaning or classification of the motion. It is the guardian of the data's label.
*   **Why it Matters:** This is the most critical principle for preventing dataset poisoning. An augmentation that changes a sign's meaning or turns "running" into "falling" is worse than no augmentation at all.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Sign Language:** The specific handshape for the letter 'D' is a critical feature. While the arm's position can be slightly augmented, the finger configuration cannot be significantly altered without changing the letter.
    *   **Activity Recognition:** For a "writing" activity, the relationship between the hand, a virtual pen, and a virtual surface is semantically critical and must be preserved.
*   **Implementation:** Achieved through a priority system that assigns low, medium, or high importance to different features, heavily constraining augmentations on high-priority (semantically critical) ones.

### 6. Environmental Interaction
*   **Definition:** An augmentation must respect the body's implicit or explicit interaction with its environment.
*   **Why it Matters:** This grounds the augmented human in a realistic 3D space, preventing physically plausible but contextually absurd motions.
*   **Key Constraints:**
    *   **Ground Plane:** For activities like walking, running, or sitting, the feet or pelvis cannot be augmented to pass through the floor.
    *   **Object Interaction:** If the motion involves an object (e.g., lifting a box), the hands must maintain a plausible relationship with that object.
    *   **Self-Collision:** A more advanced constraint ensuring limbs do not pass through the torso or each other in an unnatural way.
*   **Implementation:** Defining geometric primitives (planes, boxes) in the scene and adding constraints or penalties for intersection during augmentation.
